This repository is a place to create AppImage packages for 32-bit architecture.

If you're looking for a quick way to install, update and manage them, use "[AM](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM-Application-Manager)" or [AppMan](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AppMan).

If you are looking for their 64-bit counterparts, view my profile directly: "[github.com/ivan-hc](https://github.com/ivan-hc)"

You'll find more details on the aforementioned application managers and various packaging methods I use with my AppImage packages.
